# Bank-Management-System

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Fundamentals of Data Structures (FDS) Mini Project Documentation


### The Bank Management System is a project in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Fundamentals of Data Structures (FDS) implemented using almost all the concepts in OOP. I have also included many concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. <br/> It consists of about 2064 lines of code and many other lines as comments I really learnt a lot from this self-motivated hands on practical experience which is similar to software development.

8.	alternative procedures if card is blocked
9.	display current bank balance
10.	savings account
11.	current account
12.	minimum balance of account (Rs. 500) should be maintained

78.	user defined functions to check if stack and queue are full or empty
79.	Sleep() function to cause some delay while the bank is providing locker room services to customers in the queue
80.	Different logics to handle features of error detection

## ðŸ“ŒPROGRAM CODE :
It consists of 5 files :
1 C++ file with extension .cpp and 5 user defined C++ header files which are as follows :
1.	DriverCode.cpp : one main page of driving code in C++

2.	createBankDatabase.h : to store bank account details and for operations between them
3.	card_banking.h : to handle ATM banking
4.	Foreign_Exchange.h : to handle foreign currency exchange
5.	LockerRoom.h : to deal with high and low priority lockers
6.	LockerQueue.h : to create doubly linked priority queue and enqueue , dequeue customers in it


## ðŸ“ŒNote : 
I could have used the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ for sorting , binary searching , deque , stack , etc. but since I wanted to involve most of the C++ concepts to test my creative problem solving , technical , analytical & logical skills , efficiency and self-sufficiency, I myself have designed and defined these highlighted algorithms and data structures to satisfy my requirements. These can also be replaced by the predefined utilities of the STL in C++.

## ðŸ“ŒFurther improvements and potential upgrades in this project to be done in future : 
1.	Use of exception handling to prompt the user and guide the user input
2.	set locker password
3.	more features for the locker room
4.	forgot password option and security questions
5.	net banking password logic
6.	reactivate the blocked services if the user has contacted the bank
7.	Handle multiple ATM cards
8.	pay back loans and credit before terminating the program
9.	credit card limit
10.	change card password
11.	user defined password length restricted to n characters
12.	user defined password should include specified characters
13.	provide more bank services , etc.

## ðŸ“ŒMore concepts that can be included in this project in future :
1.	pointer to function
2.	shared pointer
3.	special pointer
4.	abstract base class
5.	Type casting (implicit and explicit)
6.	Pointers to Pointers
7.	Return pointers from functions
8.	void pointer
9.	to indicate monetary transactions done via debit and credit.
10.	number of times credit and debit card has been used , etc.
